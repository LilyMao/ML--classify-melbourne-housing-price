Despite being the city which has the longest lockdown in the world, since the start of the pandemic, the housing price in Melbourne has being growing wildly from 2020 to 2021;
Being curious about the property market, I am going to build a classification model, to classify whether a property worth 1 million or not, in Melbourne, Sep, 2021.

Datasets we use: 
1. melbourne_listing.json (retrived from Domain.com.au on 20/09/2021)
2. House_Medians3rdQtr2020.xls (download here https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victorian-property-sales-report-median-house-by-suburb/resource/92188ce7-2f5d-41bf-a57b-7dd161985420)

Tool we use:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. scikit_learn
4. matplotlib

Model: RandomForestClassifier
